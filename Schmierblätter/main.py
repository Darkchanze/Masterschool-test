## Challenge - ðŸ‘Ÿ Fitness App

- Imagine you are developing a program for a ***fitness*** app.
- The user is asked to input the duration of the workout in minutes,
  the type of exercise they did (e.g., *running*, *cycling*, *weightlifting*)
  and their location.
- The program then calculates the calories burned based on the workout type
  and duration.
- The program checks the current weather in the user's location.
- Additionally, it provides feedback on whether the user needs to hydrate
  more based on the workout intensity and weather.
- Finally, it displays the **total calories burned and the hydration recommendation**.
